Candidates’ preparation for the examination should include attempting the following practical program coding tasks.

Write and test a program to complete the three tasks.A  new  born  baby  is  kept  in  a  cot  in  a  hospital;  the  temperature  of  the  baby  is  monitored  every  10  minutes. The temperature of the baby is recorded in degrees Celsius to one decimal place and must be within the range 36.0°C to 37.5°C.

## TASK 1
To  simulate  the  monitoring  required,  write  a  routine  that  allows  entry  of  the  baby’s  temperature  in  degrees Celsius. The routine should check whether the temperature is within the acceptable range, too high or too low and output a suitable message in each case.

## TASK 2
Write  another  routine  that  stores  the  temperatures  taken  over  a  three  hour  period  in  an  array.  This  routine should output the highest and lowest temperatures and calculate the difference between these temperatures.

## TASK 3
For  a  baby  who  has  a  temperature  difference  of  more  than  one  degree  Celsius,  and/or  has  been  outside  the  acceptable  range  more  than  twice  in  the  three  hour  period,  output  a  suitable  message  giving a summary of the problem.Your program must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data. Error messages and other outputs need to be set out clearly and understandably. All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names. Each task must be fully tested.
